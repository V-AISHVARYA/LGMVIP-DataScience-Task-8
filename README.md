  ## Introduction

The goal of this project is to train a neural network to predict the next word in a sequence of words. This is achieved by using RNNs, which are well-suited for capturing sequential dependencies in data. The project is implemented using the TensorFlow and Keras libraries in Python.   

## Installation  
Install the required packages. It's recommended to set up a virtual environment before installing dependencies:

## Usage
Prepare your dataset containing sequences of words for training. Split the data into input sequences (previous words) and target sequences (next words).
Tokenize the words and convert them into numerical indices using a tokenizer.
Define your RNN model using the provided template or customize it to experiment with different architectures.
Compile the model using an appropriate loss function and optimizer.
Train the model using the prepared data.  
After training, you can generate predictions using the trained model.  

## Contributions
